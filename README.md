ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Thiago, a Data Extraction Specialist and AI enthusiast from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. 

My passion for technology ignited at the age of 14 when I attempted to develop a game using Unity and C#. This experience marked the beginning of my journey in the tech world, fueled by curiosity, adaptability, and a resilient approach to solving problems.

Throughout the years, I have refined my expertise by developing over 400+ data extraction applications, employing a wide array of frameworks, databases, and various infrastructures. 

As an AI enthusiast, I have dedicated considerable time to experimenting with transformer-based models and Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to the creation of innovative solutions.
